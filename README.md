Set Up
------

1. Clone the repository.

    ```

3. Configure the theme in your **.zshrc** file:

    ```
    ZSH_THEME="powerline"
    ```

More options
------------

All options must be overridden in your **.zshrc** file.

By default, at the right of the powerline are displayed the date and the time.
If you don't want date or time, you can choose what you want to display:

```
POWERLINE_RIGHT_A="date replacement"
POWERLINE_RIGHT_B="time replacement"
```

If you don't want the blank line before the prompt:

```
POWERLINE_NO_BLANK_LINE="true"
```

If you want full path:

```
POWERLINE_FULL_CURRENT_PATH="true"
```

If you want git info on right instead of left:

```
POWERLINE_SHOW_GIT_ON_RIGHT="true"
```

If you want to tell if you are in a remote SSH session:

```
POWERLINE_DETECT_SSH="true"
```
